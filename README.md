# JSBlitz

## Description
The aim of this project was to create a quiz to test a users proficiency in JavaScript.

## Quiz Guide
* This is a timed quiz with a duration of 60 seconds.
* The quiz is comprised of five questions that will present one at a time in succession     after the user inputs their answer.
* When the user enters their answer to the question they will be informed if their answer was correct or incorrect. An incorrect answer will result in a 10 second deduction from the timer.
* The game will end upon completion of all questions or when the timer reaches zero.

### Scoring
* The user's score is determined by their remaining time.
* The user's score will be saved to their local storage when they enter their initials.
* The user may view all saved highscores on the highscore page.
